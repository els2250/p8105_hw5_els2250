## Problem 1

#### Import data using `list.files`

``` r
long_study_df =
  tibble(
    file_names = list.files(path = "data/problem_1/", all.files = TRUE, no.. = TRUE),
    path = str_c("data/problem_1/", file_names)
  ) %>% 
  mutate(data = map(path, read_csv)) %>% 
  unnest(cols = c(data))
```

#### Tidy data

``` r
tidy_long_df = 
  long_study_df %>% 
  mutate(
    files = str_replace(file_names, ".csv", ""),
    group = str_sub(files, 1, 3)) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    week_1:week_8,
    names_to = "week",
    values_to = "outcome",
    names_prefix = "week_") %>% 
  mutate(week = as.numeric(week)) %>%
  select(group, subject = files, week, outcome)
```

#### Plot showing observations on each subject over time

``` r
tidy_long_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = outcome, group = subject, color = group)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_path() + 
  facet_grid(~group)
```

There appears to be a positive trend in the experimental group where
outcome values increase as time passes. This trend is not observed or is
not as apparent in the control group. Additionally, the values in Week 8
are higher in the experimental group compared to the control, while
values were similar in both groups in Week 1.

## Problem 2

#### Importing and describing the data

``` r
homicide_df <- 
  read_csv(
    'data/problem_2/homicide-data.csv') %>%  
  janitor::clean_names()
```

Describe the raw data. Create a city_state variable (e.g. “Baltimore,
MD”) and then summarize within cities to obtain the total number of
homicides and the number of unsolved homicides (those for which the
disposition is “Closed without arrest” or “Open/No arrest”).

Describe the Data: ***need to do***

#### Summarizing total number of homicides and number of unsolved homicides

``` r
homicide_summary <- 
  homicide_df %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, sep = ", ", state),
  ) %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarise(
    n_homs = n(),
    n_unsolved = sum(disposition == "Closed without arrest" | disposition == "Open/No arrest")
  )
```

#### Estimating proportions of unsolved homicides: Running `prop.test` for Baltimore, MD

For the city of Baltimore, MD, use the `prop.test` function to estimate
the proportion of homicides that are unsolved; save the output of
prop.test as an R object, apply the broom::tidy to this object and pull
the estimated proportion and confidence intervals from the resulting
tidy dataframe.

``` r
baltimore_hom <-
  homicide_summary %>% 
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD")

baltimore_prop <-
  prop.test(
    x = baltimore_hom %>% 
      pull(n_unsolved), 
    n = baltimore_hom %>% 
      pull(n_homs)
  ) %>% 
  broom::tidy()

baltimore_hom <-
  baltimore_hom %>% 
  mutate(
    prop_estimate = baltimore_prop %>% pull(estimate),
    conf_low = baltimore_prop %>% pull(conf.low),
    conf_high = baltimore_prop %>% pull(conf.high)
  )

baltimore_hom %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```

| city_state    | n_homs | n_unsolved | prop_estimate | conf_low | conf_high |
|:--------------|-------:|-----------:|--------------:|---------:|----------:|
| Baltimore, MD |   2827 |       1825 |         0.646 |    0.628 |     0.663 |

Still working on these sections:

#### Estimating Proportions of unsolved homicides: Running `prop.test` for each city

Now run `prop.test` for each of the cities in your dataset, and extract
both the proportion of unsolved homicides and the confidence interval
for each. Do this within a “tidy” pipeline, making use of `purrr::map`,
`purrr::map2`, list columns and unnest as necessary to create a tidy
dataframe with estimated proportions and CIs for each city.

``` r
# unsolved_prop_func = function(df) {
#   
#   prop.test(
#       x = homicide_summary %>% 
#         pull(n_unsolved), 
#       n = homicide_summary %>% 
#         pull(n_homs)
#   ) %>% 
#   broom::tidy()
# 
# }
#   
#   baltimore_hom %>% 
#     mutate(
#       prop_estimate = baltimore_prop %>% pull(estimate),
#       conf_low = baltimore_prop %>% pull(conf.low),
#       conf_high = baltimore_prop %>% pull(conf.high)
#     )
# 
# unsolved_homs <-
#   homicide_summary %>%
#   mutate(
#     results = map(homicide_summary,
#                   prop.test(
#                     x = homicide_summary %>% pull(n_unsolved),
#                     n = homicide_summary %>% pull(n_homs)),
#                   )
#   ) %>%
#   select(city_state, results) %>%
#   unnest(results)
```

#### Plot of unsolved homicide proportions and confidence intervals for each city

Create a plot that shows the estimates and CIs for each city – check out
geom_errorbar for a way to add error bars based on the upper and lower
limits. Organize cities according to the proportion of unsolved
homicides.

## Problem 3

#### Conducting a simulation to explore power in a one-sample t-test

First, we need to set the following design elements:

``` r
sim_model <- function(sample_n = 30, mu, sigma = 5) {
  
  model_df = 
    tibble(
      x = rnorm(n = sample_n, mean = mu, sd = sigma),
    )
  
  model_df %>% 
    t.test(., conf.level = 0.95) %>% 
    broom::tidy() %>% 
    select(estimate, p.value)
  
}

problem_3_dataset <- 
  5000 %>% 
  rerun(sim_model(mu = 0))
```

A dataframe consisting of 5000 datasets, where each list contains the
estimate value and the p-value for that dataset were created above.

Next, we’ll repeat this when mu = {1 ,2, 3, 4, 5, 6}:

``` r
# mu_list = 
#   list(
#     "mu = 1" = 1
#     
#   )
# 
# output = vector("list", length = 6)
# 
# output[[1]] = sim_model(mu_list[[1]])
# 
# for(i in 1:6) {
#   
#   output[[i]] = mean_and_sd(list_norm[[i]])
# 
# }
```
